In this assignment students will learn the basics of Xcode, storyboards, outlets and actions. After completing this assignment students should be able to interact with the user interface through their code.

Outlets and Actions

The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiar with the Xcode, Storyboards, IBOutlets and IBActions. The sample interface is shown below:

Task

Create a "Projects" folder anywhere on your computer. I prefer inside ~/Documents.
Create an empty repository inside the "Projects" folder and call it "OutletsAndActions".
Drag 2 labels and put them on the view.
Set the ID of the labels to "firstNameLabel" and "lastNameLabel".
Set the text of the labels to "First Name" and "Last Name".
Drag 2 text fields on the view.
Set the ID of the text fields to "firstNameTextField" and "lastNameTextField"
Drag a button on the view
Open the ViewController.m file and declare the outlets for labels and textfields.
Using Storyboard connect the outlets to their corresponding controls
Add an IBAction in the ViewController.m file and call it "submitButtonClicked".
Connect the "submitButtonClicked" action to the "Touch Up Inside" event of the button control.
Inside the submitButtonClicked method paste the following code:
NSString *firstName = self.firstNameTextField.text;
NSString *lastName = self.lastNameTextField.text;

NSString *welcomeMessage = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@",firstName,lastName];

UIAlertController *alert = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:@"Message" message:welcomeMessage preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];

[alert addAction:[UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"OK" style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault handler:^(UIAlertAction * _Nonnull action) {

}]];

[self presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
If you have made all the outlet and action connections correctly you should see an alert box displays the first name and the last name you entered in the text fields.
